# GradeTracker

Personal project with the aim to learn more about Java GUIs through a practical example. 

The ultimate goal is to create an application whose data can persist through runs and compute (and store) relevant information about each course, essentially serving as a log book for each course's individual work. Through this project, the following new concepts have been introduced thus far: JDialog, JList, ListModels, DocumentListeners, Passing data between prompts, suspending execution until JDialog exit.

#### Project Status: Working Condition...
For now the project is done so I can move on and learn new concepts in web development. If I were to return to this project I would hope to correct a lot of the imperfections in it (see future goals). As of now, however, this project has satisfied what it set out to accomplish, which was learning/practicing more with GUI work. 

#### "Future goals..."
- [ ] Ability to edit entries instead of deletion and remaking
- [ ] Store all information in a singular text file (This may be what actually happens...)
 - [ ] "Encrypt" or "Obfuscate" this file. Not sure which/what/how yet. Needs research.
- [ ] Need to display additional information too... Later...
- [ ] Add File output and input on close/open
- [ ] Reduce grade computations
- [ ] Truncate repeating decimals
